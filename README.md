# Playfair
This a Playfair encryption and decryption program. This can send encrypted messages form the client to the server where it will be decrypted. 
I order to run this program you are going to need to open two terminal windows in the filelocation that these files are placed in. First launch the server end using:

./server 4444

Then you want to launch the client side using:

./client 127.0.0.1 4444
